# Why now

I was looking at old codes and my eyes went to this repo. If I remember correctly, I was trying Ghost publishing platform which culminated in creating of this blog. I guess I got very busy with family responsibilities.

Since then there have been a series of changes. I switched to Node and Typescript (Whoa!). I also migrated to Canada, and then this transition also took some adjusting time. Created myself a working space for me this year ( and I am loving it!).

I'll try starting on some old projects that I had started, but never got time to complete ( Or might bury them deeper in grave !) LOL.

Anyways, wishing a belated happy new year..!!
