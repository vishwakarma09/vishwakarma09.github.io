Thanks for giving a visit here. I am Sandeep, a software developer who loves to be with technology. I am a graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and I have worked as Linux system admin at Kayako, shifted towards application development in Microware. Now-a-days I am in Toronto with my wife and daughter.

Cheers!
