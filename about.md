Thanks for giving a visit here. I am Sandeep, a software developer who loves to be with technology. I am a graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and I have worked as Linux system admin at Kayako, shifted towards application development in Microware. Now-a-days I am in Toronto with my wife and daughter. Working at CarltonOne as senior full stack developer.

I am a big fan of open source, and I love to contribute to open source projects. So far I have created an organisation on github, iPublic [https://github.com/ipublic-in]. I like working with Nest.js and Vue.js.

Cheers!
